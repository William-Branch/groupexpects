	abstract = {We estimate a model for the US economy with monetary/fiscal policy mix changes. Monetary policy accommodated fiscal policy through the '60s--'70s leading to high inflation. Monetary policy changed with Volcker, but inflation dropped only when fiscal policy and agents' beliefs about fiscal backing switched; successful disinflations require fiscal backing. If the monetary authority had always led or if agents had been confident about this switch, the Great Inflation would not have occurred. The policy change explains why, in the '80s, inflation dropped, debt-to-GDP reversed, output fell, and inflation persistence and volatility declined. Absent this change, inflation would have remained high for fifteen years.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates regime-switching rules for monetary policy and tax policy over the post-war period in the United States and imposes the estimated policy process on a calibrated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with nominal rigidities. Decision rules are locally unique and produce a stationary long-run rational expectations equilibrium in which (lump-sum) tax shocks always affect output and inflation. Tax non-neutralities in the model arise solely through the mechanism articulated by the fiscal theory of the price level. The paper quantifies that mechanism and finds it to be important in U.S. data, reconciling a popular class of monetary models with the evidence that tax shocks have substantial impacts. Because long-run policy behavior determines existence and uniqueness of equilibrium, in a regime-switching environment more accurate qualitative inferences can be gleaned from full-sample information than by conditioning on policy regime. },

Counterfactual experiments, in an estimated medium-scale DSGE model, reveal the US economy would have been substantially more volatile over the Great Inflation and Great Moderation periods, had average debt been consistent with levels currently observed in Italy or Japan.},
