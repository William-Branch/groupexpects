# Identifying the Impact of Inflation Expectations

## Description

This project exploits cross-sectional heterogeneity to credibly measure the pass-through from inflation expectations to inflation. 

### Abstract

Individuals form inflation expectations differently based on their demographics and locations. Consequently, different demographic groups respond differently to sectoral price changes, a fact that we exploit to identify the inflationary impact of expectations. Our instrument combines national expectations of specific groups with these groups' share in regional populations. We find that a one-percentage-point rise in the expected rate of inflation increases (regional) inflation by 60 basis points. Interestingly, long-run expectations -- say, over 5 to 10 years -- don't seem to matter much. The estimates are most robust for a particular demographic: younger, married individuals holding at least a high school diploma. Their expectations mainly influence the prices of non-durable goods.
